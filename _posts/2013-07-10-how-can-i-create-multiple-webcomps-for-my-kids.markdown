title: How can I create multiple Webcomps for my kids?â€¨
---

<p>Our system is case sensitive so you can use a parent's email address for multiple kids. Here's how:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Capitalize one letter of your email address for each child's Webcomp. So Mom's Webcomp that is registered with mom@lovekids.com could use Mom@lovekids.com for one child, and mOm@lovekids.com for another, and moM@lovekids.com for yet another. Each different capitalization is seen by our system as a unique email.</li>
</ul>
<p>Passwords can be the same across multiple Webcomps without issue.</p>
             
<p>Thats it! Remember to keep your children's photos updated at least every 4 months. Your kids may not get submitted with old photos.</p>
