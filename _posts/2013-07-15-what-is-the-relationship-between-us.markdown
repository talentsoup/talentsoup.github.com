title: What is the relationship between us?
---

<p>We value our partnership and work with Talent's best interests in mind. You are not represented by us, you are only presented by us. You are listed in our marketplace, where we provide you opportunities for success. We will present you with opportunities, it is up to you to accept or decline them. We coordinate the details, then it's up to you to shine! Because we are brokering projects, lots of small modeling agencies have chosen to get all of their Talent in the Mix.</p>
