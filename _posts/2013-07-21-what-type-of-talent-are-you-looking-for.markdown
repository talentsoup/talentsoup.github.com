title: What type of talent are you looking for?
---
<p>TalentSoup loves people and we've learned that the new face of advertising, for a lot of companies, looks like you. Yes, you. Professional model with years of experience, fresh face just getting your feet wet, actor with some stage time, or someone with no experience whatsoever.</p>

<p>The Soup contains models that command $8000 for a day's worth of work and grandmothers that make $100 an hour and are in it for the fun and experience. Regardless, we have a spot for you and we'd love to serve you up to our client's advertising media projects.</p>
