<p>We book talent in ALL types of media projects (photography, video, film) but concentrate on advertising media. Some of the busiest areas are lifestyle, fashion, business-to-business, marketing materials, non-profit, advertising and promotion.  From local companies to international corporations, we handle it all.</p>

<p>In your Webcomp, you select the types of projects you want to be considered for under the "Job Types" tab. This ensures we match the right looks to the right projects, and you don't get submitted for something you are not up for.</p>
