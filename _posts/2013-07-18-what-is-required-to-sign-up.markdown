---

<p>To sign up all you have to do is:  A)Fill out the online form.  B)Upload photos (remember, the higher the quality photos you use the better your chances at getting booked. Use clear images that show off your look and personality. Of course, if you are a hand model, be sure to include some hand shots. The same is true for swimwear and lingerie. We want to see you and what you normally look like on a day-to-day basis too. We are looking for CLEAR photos that capture your personality.) . C) Once we receive your completed Webcomp, it will be reviewed by a Talent Chef and you will receive an e-mail confirming that your profile has been activated for clients to consider for their project.</p>
