<p>That depends on the project and your experience level. Seasoned Models start at $150 an hour plus Usage, with Real People generally starting at $100 an hour (for adults). If you are chosen for a project, we will present you with the project compensation and you decide if you are interested. TalentSoup projects typically pay you the day of the shoot but always within 30 days of the booking.</p>
