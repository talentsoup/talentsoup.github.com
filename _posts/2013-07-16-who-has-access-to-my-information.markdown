title: Who has access to my information?â€¨
---

<p>None of your information is accessible by the public, ever. Zip, zilch, nada.</p>

<p>TalentSoup takes confidentiality very seriously. Once you are preliminarily selected for a specific project, our client will have access to only your photos and sizes. Once you are booked, your phone number will be given to the project manager for scheduling. We will never sell or knowingly provide your information for any purpose other than those outlined in our Terms Of Use. Your Webcomp is only available when you send it out, and the Public Link has all contact information removed as well as displaying your First Name and first letter of your Last Name.</p>
