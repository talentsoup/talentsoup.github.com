title: How do you define talent?
---
<p>We define Talent this way:</p>

<p><b>Professional Model:</b> Free Agent or Represented (have your agent contact us for more information about how we can play together), Experienced, having earned a minimum $1000 day rate in the last year. Tear sheets in your profile as well as your comp card are ideal to maximize your rate.</p>

<p><b>Fresh Face:</b> New to modeling, independent or represented, some experience but needing to build more work for your portfolio. Made less than $1000 per day in the last year. No tear sheets or examples. Should have a comp card or at least some pro images in your Profile.</p>

<p><b>Actors:</b> We book lots of actors for projects that need a unique look in front of the camera and our pool of actors never let us down. You might fall somewhere in the range of Pro or Fresh.</p>

<p><b>Real People:</b> Yep, pretty obvious here. Babies to Grandmothers, we've got them all in every shade and size you can imagine. We love our Real People and our clients do too!</p>
