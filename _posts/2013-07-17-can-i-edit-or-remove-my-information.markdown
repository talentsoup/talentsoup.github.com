<p>You have total control over what information you provide, adding or removing images and the types of jobs you want to be considered for. Just remember your login and password. We make every effort to provide real value for our talent but know that sometimes we'll part ways.</p>
<p>Cancelling your account is easy. Just go to the Communication Settings tab in your Webcomp, scroll to the bottom and click the button that says CANCEL MY ACCOUNT. Follow the instructions and you are done. Of course, we'd welcome you back should something change.</p>
