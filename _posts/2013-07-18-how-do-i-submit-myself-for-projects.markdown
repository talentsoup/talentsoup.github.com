title: How do I submit myself for projects? How do I indicate my availability?

<p>TalentSoup is different from casting sites you may have seen, mainly because we're not a casting site! Our technology allows us to automate the booking process. Basically a client comes to us with the demographics they need for a given project, and we run those demographics through our system and build galleries of everyone matching the client's requirements in the given location where they are shooting. This happens automatically, regardless of whether or not you are a <a href="https://talentsoup.com/talent_home#pricing-fee-example">Pro or Entry</a> Webcomp. For a more detailed explanation of the process, see <a href="http://blog.talentsoup.com/post/20074361803/chefs-secret-sauce-how-getting-booked-in-talentsoup">http://blog.talentsoup.com/post/20074361803/chefs-secret-sauce-how-getting-booked-in-talentsoup</a>.</p>

<p>What this means in practical terms is that you cannot, and don't have to, submit yourself for a casting in TalentSoup. All you have to do is fill out your Webcomp with as much information as possible, and keep it up to date, as well as upload high quality photos.  We do the rest based on the client's requirements.</p>

<p>If you are submitted to a project by our system, you will get an email asking about your availability.
