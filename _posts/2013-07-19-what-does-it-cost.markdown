title: What does it cost for talent to sign up?
---
<p>Our business model is built on booking talent, not selling them a worthless web page. You decide how to partner with us (free or paid) and yes, Entry Brands get submitted to relevant projects, not just paid Brands. Here is more info:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Two ways we can work together: Pro and Entry Brands.</p></li>
  <li><p>Pro has monthly fees but keep all of their fees when booked. Entry has no monthly fee but we keep 20% of your payment when we book you.</p></li>
</ul> 
<p>We believe in trust, communication and transparency. If you have a question, ask it. We'll do our best to be open and honest. There are lots of folks out there taking advantage of Talent and we'll never be one of them.</p>
